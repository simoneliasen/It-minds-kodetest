This test includes 8 assignments, which we want you to solve!

Please feel free to use the internet for obtaining additional knowledge and info.
Being able to identify your problem, formulate it and find the right approach, is a big part of being a software developer!

Each assignment has its own subfolder where you will find a Readme specifying the task and a project folder of the language of your choice - Java or C#. 

For C# a solution file with a project for each assignment is located in the "source" folder.

For Java individual src files are provided for each assignment.

Your delivery for this project should be a zipped version of the entire repository.
